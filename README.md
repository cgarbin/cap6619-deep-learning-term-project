# Deep Learning Term Project

This repository has the code used to produce the results for the Florida Atlantic University's
CAP-6619 Deep Learning class, Fall 2018.

This was my first real-file (of sorts) experience with machine learning and the first time
I wrote a significant amount of Python code. It's not a polished result by any means.
Suggestions for improvements are always appreciated.

The objective of the term project was to compare [Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580) and
[Batch Normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf).

The report is available [here](./report/CAP6619_term_project_cgarbin.pdf). Note that this is not
the report I delivered for the class. Every so often I correct a mistake in it or improve an
item. To see the original report, go to the first version in the file history.

The LaTeX files used to create the report are available [here](./report).
